Chengdu Metro QR code generator

In order to solve the problem of lagging when opening the Chengdu Metro app, Tianfu Tong has many advertisements that affect the user experience. Later I found that the WeChat and Alipay applets were actually quite fast.

A static HTML webpage was generated based on WeChat mini program packet capture analysis, which can be directly opened with a mobile phone to access a single file. Alipay is the same implementation, but the URL is different and there are comments in the code.

Quick Start
1. Need to use a root machine or directly grab the token of WeChat mini program on the computer
2. Fill in the token to obtain the QR code, which will automatically refresh within 30 seconds
